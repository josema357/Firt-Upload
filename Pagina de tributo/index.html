            <h2>Here is a timeline of the life of Jesus of Nazareth</h2>
            <ul>
                <li>Birth</li>
                <p>When Jesus was born in Belen of Judea on the day of King Herod, some wise men came from the east
                    to Jerusalem, saying: Where is the king of the Jews, who has been born? For we have seen his star in
                    the east, and we have come to worship him.<strong> Mateo 2:1-2</strong></p>
                <li>Baptism</li>
                <p>Then Jesus came from Galilee to John, in the Jordan, to be baptized by him.
                    But Juan opposed him, saying: I need to be baptized by you, and you come to me?
                    But Jesus replied: Thus it becomes us to fulfill all righteousness. So he left it.<strong> Mateo 3:13-15</strong></p>
                <li>Gospel</li>
                <p>Jesus answered and said to them, â€œAssuredly, I say to you, if you have faith and do not doubt, you
                    will not only do this to the fig tree, but if you say to this mountain, 'Remove and throw yourself
                    into the sea,' it will be done.<strong> Mateo 21:21</strong></p>
                <p>Then Jesus, looking at them, said: -For men it is impossible, but not for God, because all things are
                    possible with God.<strong> Marcos 10:27</strong></p>
                <p>Since then, Jesus began to preach and say: Repent, because the kingdom of heaven has drawn near.
                    <strong> Mateo 4:17</strong></p>
                <p>For to this end the gospel was preached even to the dead, so that though they be judged as men in the
                    flesh, they might live in the spirit according to the will of God.<strong> 1 Pedro 4:6</strong></p>
                <li>Last Supper</li>
                <p>When the time came, Jesus and the apostles sat together at the table. Jesus said: I have longed to
                    eat this Passover with you before my sufferings begin.<strong> Lucas 22:14-15</strong></p>
                <li>Death</li>
                <p>The soldiers also mocked him, approaching and presenting him with vinegar, and saying: If you are the
                    King of the Jews, save yourself. There was also above him a title written in Greek, Latin, and
                    Hebrew letters: THIS IS THE KING OF THE JEWS.</p>
                <li>Resurrection</li>
                <p>And they found the stone rolled away from the tomb; and going in, they did not find the body of the
                    Lord Jesus. It happened that being perplexed by this, behold, two men stood by them in resplendent
                    garments; and as they were afraid, and lowered their faces to the ground, they said to them: Why do
                    you seek among the dead the one who lives?.<strong> Lucas 24:2-5</strong></p>
            </ul>
